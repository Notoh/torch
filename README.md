Torch*
============
Torch is a scientific computing framework with wide support for machine learning algorithms. It is easy to use and efficient, thanks to an easy and fast scripting language, LuaJIT, and an underlying C/CUDA implementation.

Intel®Software Optimization for Torch
============
This fork is dedicated to improving Torch performance when running on CPU, in particular Intel® Xeon processors (HSW, BDW, Xeon Phi)


### Requirements
If you have installed the lastest MKL version: parallel_studio_xe_2017. The autoDownloadMKL branch will be compiled smoothly as the master branch. 

You don't have to worry if you havn't prepared the whole MKL. Because the prepare_mkl.sh script can help you download substitute goods automatically from github. It's necessary to warn you that some test cases of torch module fail due to the substitute libraries doesn't provide whole Linear Algebra Package(LAPACK), but all test cases of nn module pass successfully. So you can build your deep learning model safely and enjoy acceleration of MKL.



### Building
You need not specify MKL path extraly. The install.sh will detect MKL you prepared or substitute goods from github.

Install this repo, which installs the torch distribution, with a lot of nice goodies. 

You can specify which compiler to compile the project, and the default compiler is gcc & g++.
```sh
git clone https://github.com/intel/torch.git ./torch -b autoDownloadMKL
cd ~/torch; bash install-deps;
./install.sh        #use gcc to install torch
./install.sh intel  #use icc to install torch
```

By default Torch will install LuaJIT 2.1. If you want other options, you can use the command:
```sh
TORCH_LUA_VERSION=LUA51 ./install.sh
TORCH_LUA_VERSION=LUA52 ./install.sh
```


### Cleaning
To remove all the temporary compilation files you can run:
```bash
./clean.sh
```

### Test
You can test that all libraries are installed properly by running:
```bash
./test.sh
```
Tested on Ubuntu 14.04, CentOS 7.

<font color=#00ffff size=8>`Some test cases of torch module fail` as mentioned above. But all failed cases are related to LAPACK and the amount of them is 21 On my machine (OS:Ubuntu 16.04).</font> 


### Performance
